# SunsCore

This is the functional, pure core of my implementation of Mike Hutchinson's "A Billion Suns" tabletop miniatures game.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `suns_core` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:suns_core, in_umbrella: true}
  ]
end
```
