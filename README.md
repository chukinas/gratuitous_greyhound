To start your Phoenix server:

  * install asdf and the plugins for erlang, elixer, node, and yarn
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Jonathan's Notes while trying to get this to work in WSL

  * remove package lock
  * remove tool opts copy
  * should yarn.lock be in top level?
  * change elixir version to 1.11 in mix.exs?
