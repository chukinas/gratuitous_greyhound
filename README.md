# Overview

This is the project for my personal website. As of Jan 2021, I am using it mainly as a platform for developing a browser-based game called Dreadnought.

# How to run locally

  * install asdf and the plugins for erlang, elixer, node, and yarn
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Visit the website at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

# Gigalixir deployment

  * I deploy the application via Gigalixir. Visit the site at [www.chukinas.com](http://www.chukinas.com).
  * The `*buildpack.config` files are required per the docs: https://gigalixir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started-guide.html#specify-versions
