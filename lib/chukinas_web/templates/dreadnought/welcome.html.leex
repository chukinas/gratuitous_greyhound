        The Game
      </h2>
      <p class="font-serif">
        Progressively pre-program your battleships' movement and watch those decisions play out. 
        Can you find the enemy first?
        Will your maneuvers expose the enemy to your full broadside while minimizing your exposure to theirs?
      </p>

        Inspiration
      </h2>
      <p class="font-serif">
        Every good game stands on the shoulders of the greats that came before it.
        This game takes the best parts of some of my favorites:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc font-serif ml-4">
        <li>
          The progressive planning of <b>Sails of Glory</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          The 'plan and see what happens' of <b>Galaxy Trucker</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          The limited decision space of <b>Memoir '44</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Larger ships require more pre-planning a la <b>Star Wars Armada</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each ship has a deck of cards that desribes its movement a la <b>Wings of Glory</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Roadmap
      </h2>
      <p class="font-serif">
        Currently in phase 1: developing the main aesthetic and proving out some concepts.
        Phase 2 will begin in Feb 2021, and will see ship command and maneuvers implemented.
